# FileCheck
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/llvm-swift/FileCheck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/llvm-swift/FileCheck)

A standalone Swift version of LLVM's flexible pattern matching file verifier

## Introduction

FileCheck is a utility for verifying the contents of two files match (for example,
one from standard input, and one residing on disk).  This implementation of
FileCheck emphasizes its use as a tool for checking output generated by programs
against an expected set of strings that can be specified inline next to the
`print` statement that generated it.

The primary API in this package is the `fileCheckOutput` function, which comes
with a number of convenient optional parameters to modify the behavior of the
verification process.  For example, here is a self-contained test that verifies 
the output of FizzBuzz:

```swift
assert(fileCheckOutput(withPrefixes: ["FIZZBUZZ"]) {
  for i in (1..<10) {
    var out = ""
    if i % 3 == 0 {
      out += "Fizz"
    }
    if i % 5 == 0 {
      out += "Buzz"
    }
    if out.isEmpty {
      out += "\(i)"
    }
    // FIZZBUZZ: 1
    // FIZZBUZZ-NEXT: 2
    // FIZZBUZZ-NEXT: Fizz
    // FIZZBUZZ-NEXT: 4
    // FIZZBUZZ-NEXT: Buzz
    // FIZZBUZZ-NEXT: Fizz
    // FIZZBUZZ-NEXT: 7
    // FIZZBUZZ-NEXT: 8
    // FIZZBUZZ-NEXT: Fizz
    print(out)
  }
})
```

Executing this test in any file will cause FileCheck to read it in
from disk and verify the output of the program against the check-strings in the 
comments.

## Setup

**Using The Swift Package Manager**

- Add FileCheck to your `Package.swift` file's dependencies section:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/llvm-swift/FileCheck.git", versions: Version(0,0,1)..<Version(1,0,0))
```
